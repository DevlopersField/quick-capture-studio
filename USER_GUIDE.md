## 🎥 Step 1: Record Your Screen Like a Pro

Recording a video is as easy as clicking the extension icon.

1.  **Start Recording**: Click the extension and choose "Record Screen".
2.  **Move the Toolbar**: Don't like where the toolbar is? Just click on the **Timer / Red Dot area** and drag it anywhere you want!
3.  **Draw as You Talk**: Grab the **Pencil**, **Arrow**, or **Rectangle** tool to highlight things in real-time. Want to leave a note? Use the **Text Tool**.
4.  **Magic Sync**: If you open a new tab while recording, your drawing tools and annotations will follow you automatically. It's like one giant canvas over your whole browser!
5.  **Finish Up**: Click the big red **"Stop"** button. You'll be whisked away to the Studio instantly.

## 📸 Step 2: Capture the Whole Page

Need to grab a long landing page? Our engine handles the heavy lifting.

1.  **One Click**: Select "Full Page Capture".
2.  **Hands Off**: Sit back for a few seconds while the extension scrolls and stitches the page. We even handle sticky headers and footers so they don't overlap!
3.  **Perfect Stitching**: Your capture will open in the Studio, looking exactly like the real website.
