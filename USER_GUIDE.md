## 📸 Capturing a Website

Need a screenshot? You have two great options:

### 1. Capture Full Page
This is our favorite. It scrolls the entire page for you and stitches it into one perfect, high-resolution image.
- Perfect for landing pages, long articles, or design reviews.

### 2. Selected Area
Just want a snippet? Click and drag over the part of the screen you want to save.

## 🎨 Professional Editing in the Studio

Once you have a capture, the **Studio** is where the magic happens. It works just like your favorite design tools (like Figma):

- **Move Around**: Hold the **Spacebar** and drag your mouse to pan around your canvas.
- **Zoom In**: Use your mouse wheel (or pinch on your trackpad) to zoom into the details.
- **Type Anything**: Click the **Text** tool, tap anywhere, and start typing. 
- **Light or Dark?**: Use the Sun/Moon icon in the top right to switch themes instantly.
- **Save it Your Way**: Export your final masterpiece as a **PNG**, **PDF**, or just copy it to your clipboard.
