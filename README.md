### 🎯 Pro Tip: Capture & Record Simultaneously
You can record your screen and annotate live at the same time using the **Sticky PiP Toolbar**:
1. Start a **Screen Recording**.
2. A small floating **Picture-in-Picture (PiP)** window will appear automatically.
3. Switch to the tab or application you are recording.
4. Use the annotation tools in the PiP window to draw on your "canvas" (the screen being recorded).
5. Your live annotations will be captured as part of the video recording!
